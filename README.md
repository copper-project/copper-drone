## Tutorial: Copper on a Drone Series

This GitHub project supports the video tutorial series on how to use [Copper](https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs),  
the Rust-based robotics runtime.

From zero to flight, the series walks through building a simple robotics stackâ€”including hardware integration, computer vision, control, communication, and deploymentâ€”on a twitchy 3.5" freestyle drone.

The goal is twofold: to build a complete reference project using Copper, and to develop reusable Copper components along the way (e.g., GStreamer, AprilTags).
